# What Are We Exploring?

![vote](vote.jpg)

This project examines claims made by presidential candidates about factors that impact Americans' daily lives. The goal of this project is to provide voters with a clear, data-driven understanding of key political issues: student loan debt, economic health, abortion, and immigration. Through narrative visualizations, we aim to help voters make informed decisions based on facts and trends, rather than rhetoric alone.

# What Are Student Loans?

Student loans are financial tools that help individuals cover the cost of higher education, including tuition, housing, and other expenses. Federal loans, provided by the government, are among the most common, with varying types for undergraduate and graduate students.

# Why Are Student Loans Important?

In the United States, student loan debt exceeds $1.7 trillion, affecting nearly 45 million Americans. Student debt can impact quality of life, delay home ownership, and even affect career choices. This issue has been central to recent presidential debates, with candidates proposing different solutions, including loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans. Understanding the nuances of student loans—who carries this debt, how it’s distributed across demographics, and how it impacts economic choices—is essential to informed voting on related policy proposals.

# How Do Student Loans Affect Americans?

This section will visualize data on student loans by age, education level, institution type, and major. We’ll look at:

- **Loan Type**: Federal undergraduate vs. graduate loans.
- **Age & Marital Status**: How debt varies by age and marital status.
- **Institution Type**: Comparing debt across public, private nonprofit, and for-profit institutions.
- **Majo**r\*\*: Which fields of study correlate with higher debt levels, reflecting varying educational costs and potential income after graduation.

# Terminology to Know

- **Federal Undergraduate Loans**: Loans issued by the federal government for undergraduate students, often with lower interest rates and varying repayment options.
- **Federal Graduate Loans**: Loans available for graduate students, often at higher interest rates.
- **Loan Forgiveness**: Programs or policies that relieve borrowers from repaying part or all of their federal loans.
- **Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)**: A repayment plan that bases monthly payments on the borrower’s income and family size, intended to make repayment more manageable for low-income earners.

# The National Average Student Loan Debt Amount Is **$46,697**.

The bar graph below unpacks the complexities of student loan debt through three major lenses: Institution **Type and Major**, **Racial and Gender Disparities**, and **Personal Circumstances**, offering crucial insights that can shape your understanding of education policy debates.

- **Institution Type and Major**: The type of college and choice of major heavily influence borrowing outcomes. Students at for-profit institutions have the highest average debt of $54,900, compared to $41,200 at public colleges. Additionally, fields of study like biological and physical sciences lead to the highest debt at $71,300, whereas business and education majors have some of the lowest debt levels, around $37,000 to $38,000. Voters may weigh these differences when evaluating candidates’ proposals for regulating higher education costs or expanding access to public institutions.

- **Racial and Gender Disparities**: The data highlights significant inequities, with Black students carrying the highest average debt ($57,700) and women borrowing more than men ($46,900 versus $44,200). These disparities underline systemic challenges that some candidates aim to address through loan forgiveness or targeted financial support for underserved communities. Voters who are impacted by or care about these inequities might consider how each candidate’s policies could help bridge these financial gaps.

- **Personal Circumstances**: Age and marital status further impact borrowing, as older students (30 or older) borrow more on average ($45,600) and unmarried individuals with dependents have the highest debt burden at $49,100. In contrast, married individuals with dependent children tend to have lower debt at $39,200. Candidates who propose relief for older borrowers or support systems for single parents might influence voters facing these challenges.

# What is the Federal Student Loan Distribution among US College Students?

The chart below provides a breakdown of federal student loan distribution among U.S. college students based on various demographic factors, including age, institution type, major, and marital status. It distinguishes between federal undergraduate loans (in orange) and federal graduate loans (in blue) to highlight how loan reliance varies across different student profiles.

Key takeaways:

- Younger students (23 or younger) primarily rely on federal undergraduate loans, while those aged 30 or older have a relatively high dependency on federal graduate loans, reflecting older students' greater participation in graduate programs.
- Students at for-profit institutions tend to rely more on federal undergraduate loans compared to those at public or private nonprofit institutions, which may indicate higher tuition costs at for-profits.
- Across majors, those studying healthcare and business have notable amounts of both undergraduate and graduate loans, whereas majors like humanities and social sciences show less reliance on federal graduate loans.
